<h1>Bamboo Git Plugin</h1>

integration server.

It is compatible with Bamboo 2.2.x and above.

INSTALLATION

   1. Copy to $BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
   2. Restart Bamboo

Now when you create or edit plans you will be able to select “Git” as the
repository provider.

Right now the plugin is very rough and has very few options but it works.

All the groundwork was done by Don Brown from Atlassian. Until Atlassian can
provide resources to the plugin I will be mantaining it here on github.

==== USAGE WARNING ====
If you are using SSH make sure to use ssh keys. In general, make sure that a
background script can pull from your repo. If it can't then Bamboo will not be
able to checkout neither.

1.1.5 RELEASE NOTES

- Fixed problem with rebased repos where out-of order dates would cause bamboo
  to loop infinitely.

1.1.4 RELEASE NOTES

- Commit SHA1 numbers are included in top-level build log.
- Better error message when non-existing branch is selected for build

1.1.3 RELEASE NOTES
(big thanks to Kristian Rosenvold)
- This should support branches properly. Please note that when changing
  branches on a build, you still need to clean the build using the bamboo
  console. 

- This should also fix the file list in the commit history view.

- Also, in 1.1.1 you needed to specify “checkout” as a subdirectory name under
  configuration\builder. This should not be done for this version of the plugin
  (the “checkout” folder is still used in the file structure internally, but
  the plugin tells bamboo about it so that you dont have to do it on every
  build!)

- The fix also contains working unit tests for some features.
